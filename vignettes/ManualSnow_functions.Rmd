# Details of the Manual Snow Data Function

This vignette contains more detail regarding the manual snow data function get_manual_swe(), including examples of the different options that the user must specify when employing the function.

## Specifying Station ID

The function can retrieve one, multiple, or all manual snow surveys through the "station_id" function. The default setting is "All". The manual snow survey dataset is much smaller than the dataset that the function for retrieving data from the automated snow weather stations, so using the options for retrieving all data (all sites, all survey periods, all years), is much faster and less prone to errors of data omission.


```
# Retrieve one station, all survey periods, all years.
test <- get_manual_swe(station_id = "4C03",
                       survey_period = "All",
                       use_archive = "No",
                       get_year = "All") 

# Retrieve two stations, all survey periods, all years.
test_2 <- get_manual_swe(station_id = c("1E03A", "4A10"),
                         survey_period = "All",
                         use_archive = "No",
                         get_year = "All") 

# Retrieve all stations, all survey periods, all years.
test_3 <- get_manual_swe(station_id = "All",
                         survey_period = "All",
                         use_archive = "No",
                         get_year = "All") 
```

## Specifying Survey Period

The function can also retrieve data from a specific manual snow survey period. The default setting is "All", although the user can also specify a specific survey period. This must be in the format "01-Jan" or "01-01", and must correspond to one of the manual survey periods. 

Manual snow surveys are available for: 01-Jan, 01-Feb, 01-March, 01-Apr, 01-May, 15-May, and 01-Jun. Note that the June measurements may be missing for many stations if the snow has already melted for the particular site you are looking for.

Survey period options:
01-Jan; 01-01
01-Feb; 02-01
01-Mar; 03-01
01-Apr; 04-01
01-May; 05-01
15-May; 05-15
01-Jun; 06-01
15-Jun; 06-15

Examples:

```
# Get all survey periods
test_manual_sp1 <- get_manual_swe(station_id = "All",
                                 survey_period = "All",
                                 use_archive = "No",
                                 get_year = "All")

# Get only the May 15th survey period for all stations across all years.
test_manual_sp2 <- get_manual_swe(station_id = "All",
                                  survey_period = "15-May",
                                  use_archive = "No",
                                  get_year = "All") 
```

## Specifying Year

The user can also specify the year (water year) that the function retrieves. Note that water year is the same as calendar year because manual snow surveys are not performed in October - December.

```
# Get all years for all stations and all survey periods
test_manual_year1 <- get_manual_swe(station_id = "All",
                                 survey_period = "All",
                                 get_year = "All",
                                 use_archive = "No")

# Get only data from the 2019 water year for all stations and all survey periods
test_manual_year2 <- get_manual_swe(station_id = "All",
                                 survey_period = "All",
                                 get_year = "2019",
                                 use_archive = "No")
```

## Using the Caching Functions

The manual snow data function also contains the ability to cache the data archive and current year data on your local drive. The purpose of this is to speed up the data retrieval process, which is more critical when the data retreival function is used within downstream functions (for example, those that analyze statistics). As the data is smaller than the large ASWE dataset, caching has less of an impact on the data processing speed and so is not recommended, although the option remains if the user wants to save a version of the data on their own computer.

If the user prefers to use the data cache, they can turn it on using the "use_archive" variable. If "use_archive" is set to "Yes", then the user must also set whether to automatically update the stored version of the data on their machine ('update_archive'), as well as teh directory in which the data is saved ('directory_archive').

update_archive: Can be either "Yes" or "No" If it is "Yes", then the function will download a copy of the manual data archive from the Data Catalogue and save it (in an RDS format that is readable by R) in the directory that is specified by the user ('directory_archive' variable). If the user choses "No", then the data is not downloaded from the Data Catalogue, and the historic manual snow data is instead read from the directory that is specified from the user. If there is no data present, or if the stored data is more than 30 days old, the data is automatically downloaded from the Data Catalogue and the archived data updated.

directory_archive = Where the data cache is stored on the user's computer. The path file can be anywhere, but it must end with a "/". If the user doesn't specify where the data will be stored, it is saved in the current directory of the user's R session (./data/cache/")


```
# Function will retrieve all data from the Data Catalogue and save a version of the historic data at the directory specified.
test_manual_cache1 <- get_manual_swe(station_id = "All",
                                 survey_period = "All",
                                 get_year = "All",
                                 use_archive = "Yes",
                                 update_archive = "Yes",
                                 directory_archive = "C:/Users/AJOLLYMO/RProjects/SnowData_archive/cache/")

# Function will retrieve historic data previously cached at the archive location indicated. 
# If there is no data at this location, or if the historic data is more than 30 days old, it will be  
# automatically downloaded from the Data Catalogue and a new cache saved at the specified location.
test_manual_cache2 <- get_manual_swe(station_id = "All",
                                 survey_period = "All",
                                 get_year = "All",
                                 use_archive = "Yes",
                                 update_archive = "No",
                                 directory_archive = "C:/Users/AJOLLYMO/RProjects/SnowData_archive/cache/")
```
