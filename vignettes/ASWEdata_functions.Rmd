# Details of the ASWE Data Function

This vignette details the use of get_aswe_databc(), a function that retrieves data obtained by the automated snow weather stations (ASWE) from the BC Data Catalogue. Data retrieved from this function includes snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, precipitation (accumulated) and air temperature (daily maximum and minimum).

This vignette details the various options that the user must determine in using the function.

## Specifying Station ID

The function can retrieve one, multiple, or all manual snow surveys through the "station_id" variable. The default setting is "All". Because the ASWE dataset is very large, attempting to retrieve all stations for multiple years is not recommended (it takes a long time, and could result in data truncation). The user can also specify a single or multiple years.

```
# Retrieve SWE for one station (all years on record)
test_ID1 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = "2F05P",
                          get_year = "All",
                          parameter_id = "SWE",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE) 

# Retrieve SWE for one year across all stations
test_ID2 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = "All",
                          get_year = "2019",
                          parameter_id = "SWE",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE) 

# Retrieve SWE for one year across two stations
test_ID3 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = c("2F10P", "4D10P"),
                          get_year = "2019",
                          parameter_id = "SWE",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE) 
```

## Specifying Year

The user can also specify the year (by water year) that the function retrieves. The default is "All" (as shown in the station ID example), although the user can also specify one year (as also shown in the station ID example) or several years (shown below):


```
# Retrieve SWE for two years year across one station
test_year1 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = "2F10P",
                          get_year = c("2019", "2018"),
                          parameter_id = "SWE",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE)
```

## Specifying the Type of Data Retrieved: Parameter ID

ASWE stations collection four type of data: SWE, snow depth, temperature and air temperature. All four can be retrieved through the function using the 'parameter_ID' variable, of which there are four choices:

parameter_id = "SWE"
parameter_id = "Snow_Depth"
parameter_id = "Precipitation"
parameter_id = "Temperature"

```
# Retrieve SWE for one year across one station
test_p1 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = "2F10P",
                          get_year = c("2019"),
                          parameter_id = "SWE",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE)

# Retrieve snow depth for one year across one station
test_p2 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = "2F10P",
                          get_year = c("2019"),
                          parameter_id = "Snow_Depth",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE)

# Retrieve accumulated precipitation for one year across one station
test_p3 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = "2F10P",
                          get_year = c("2019"),
                          parameter_id = "Precipitation",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE)

# Retrieve air temperature (daily max and min) for one year across one station
test_p4 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = "2F10P",
                          get_year = c("2019"),
                          parameter_id = "Temperature",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE)
```

## Data Caching Functions

As the data collected from the ASWE stations is very large, reading the entire archive of data from the Data Catalogue can take some time. Thus, both get_aswe_databc() and get_manual_databc() cache data in an .rmd format on the user's computer to speed data acquisition. Specifically, archived data (i.e., older than the current water year) is cached on the user's computer. The user can choose to manually over write the cached data (force = FALSE). If no data has been cached (for example, if this is the first time the function is being use to retrieve a particular variable), the user can specify whether they will be asked to opt into creating a new data directory (ask = TRUE/FALSE). If ask = true, the function will ask the user permission to create said directory; if the user specifies 'no', then the function will stop. 

```
# Retrieve SWE for one year across one station. Use a data cache without updating it, and check that the data
# exists at "C:/Users/AJOLLYMO/RProjects/SnowData_archive/cache/"
test_c1 <- get_aswe_databc(station_id = "2F10P",
                          get_year = c("2019"),
                          parameter_id = "SWE",
                          force = FALSE,
                          ask = FALSE)
```
